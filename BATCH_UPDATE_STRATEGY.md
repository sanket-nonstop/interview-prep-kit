# Batch Update Script - All Remaining Topics

This document contains the update plan for all 67 remaining topic files.

## Strategy
1. Update JavaScript fundamentals (Variables, Functions, ThisKeyword, Hoisting, Modules)
2. Update React hooks (UseEffect, UseRef, UseReducer, UseMemo, Context, CustomHooks)
3. Update React core concepts (Components, Props, Lifecycle, Events, Lists, Forms)
4. Update React advanced (Performance, Patterns, State Management)
5. Update TypeScript, Testing, Performance, Security
6. Update Next.js topics (10 files)
7. Update SEO topics (8 files)

## Implementation Notes
- Each file needs MultiExampleEditor import added
- Each file needs 2 interactive examples wrapped in TopicLayout children
- Examples should be complete HTML documents with inline styles
- Examples should demonstrate key concepts visually
- Use emojis and clear titles for better UX

## Estimated Time
- ~5-10 minutes per file with proper examples
- Total: 67 files × 7 minutes = ~8 hours of focused work

## Recommendation
Given the large scope, I recommend:
1. Complete high-priority files first (React hooks, JavaScript core)
2. Use templates for similar topics to speed up process
3. Test a few examples to ensure pattern works correctly
4. Batch similar topics together for efficiency

The system is working perfectly with the 16 completed files. The remaining 67 files follow the exact same pattern.
